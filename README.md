### Robust controller design for stochastic nonlinear systems via convex optimization
This repository contains the source codes ot the [CV-STEM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04359) for the convex optimization-based robust feedback control of It√¥ stochastic nonlinear systems.\
* There is a new concept called [Neural Contraction Metrics (NCMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04361), which can be used for real-time robust nolinear estimation and control via convex optimization. 
* **Please see the [NCM python package](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm) first** before reading the source codes in this repository.
