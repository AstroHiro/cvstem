### Robust controller design for stochastic nonlinear systems via convex optimization
Codes for designing ConVex Optimization-based Stochastic steady-state Tracking Error Minimization Control
This repository contains the source codes ot the [CV-STEM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04359) for the convex optimization-based robust feedback control of Itô stochastic nonlinear systems.\
** There is a new concept called [Neural Contraction Metrics (NCMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04361), which can be used for real-time robust nolinear estimation and control via convex optimization approach. Please see [here](https://github.com/AstroHiro/ncm) for the python package that automatically constructs an NCM for a given nonlinear dynamical systems. **
